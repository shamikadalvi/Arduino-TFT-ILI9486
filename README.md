# Arduino-TFT-ILI9486
This is a modified and simplified code of Adafriut GFX and MCUFriend 
This works for Arduino TFT shield 3.5 " 480*320 with driver ILI9486
As of now it has functions of drawing pixel,fillScreen and fillRect 
It works for sure as I have coded and tested it 
No libraries or any other file is required It uses only 10% of program storage
